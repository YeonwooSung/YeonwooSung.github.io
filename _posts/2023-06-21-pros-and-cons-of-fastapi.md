## Pros

- FastAPI is very fast and efficient, making it a great choice for building high-performance APIs.
- It has a simple and intuitive syntax that makes it easy to learn and use, even for beginners.
- FastAPI has built-in support for asynchronous programming, which can help improve the performance of your application.
- It comes with automatic documentation generation, which can save you a lot of time and effort.
- FastAPI has a large and active community, which means you can easily find help and support when you need it.

## Cons

- FastAPI is a relatively new framework, which means it may not have all the features and capabilities of more established frameworks.
- It requires Python 3.6 or later, which may be a problem if you are working with an older version of Python.
- FastAPI’s focus on performance and efficiency may make it less suitable for smaller projects where speed is not a major concern.
- The framework’s reliance on type annotations may make it more difficult to work with if you are not familiar with this feature of Python.
- FastAPI’s documentation can be overwhelming at times, especially for beginners who are just getting started with the framework.
